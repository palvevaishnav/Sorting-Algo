Generally, there is always more than one way to solve a problem in computer science with different algorithms. Therefore, it is highly required to use a method to compare the solutions in order to judge which one is more optimal. The method must be:

Independent of the machine and its configuration, on which the algorithm is running on.
Shows a direct correlation with the number of inputs.
Can distinguish two algorithms clearly without ambiguity.
There are two such methods used, time complexity and space complexity which are discussed below:

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. 
Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.

Space Complexity: 
The space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. 
Consider an example: Suppose a problem to find the frequency of array elements.
